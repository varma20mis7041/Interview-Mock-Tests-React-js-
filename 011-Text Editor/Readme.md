## Initial State

- Initially, `#f1f5f9` color is applied to all three buttons: bold, italic, and underline.

## Bold Icon Button

- When the bold icon button is clicked:
  - It changes to an active state by applying the `#faff00` color.
  - The bold `font-weight` is applied to the text in the HTML textarea element.
  - If the bold icon button is already in the active state:
    - The respective button becomes inactive by applying `#f1f5f9` color.
    - The normal `font-weight` is applied to the text in the HTML textarea element.

## Italic Icon Button

- When the italic icon button is clicked:
  - It changes to an active state by applying the `#faff00` color.
  - The italic `font-style` is applied to the text in the HTML textarea element.
  - If the italic icon button is already in the active state:
    - The respective button becomes inactive by applying `#f1f5f9` color.
    - The normal `font-style` is applied to the text in the HTML textarea element.

## Underline Icon Button

- When the underline icon button is clicked:
  - It changes to an active state by applying the `#faff00` color.
  - The underline `text-decoration` is applied to the text in the HTML textarea element.
  - If the underline icon button is already in the active state:
    - The respective button becomes inactive by applying `#f1f5f9` color.
    - The normal `text-decoration` is applied to the text in the HTML textarea element.
